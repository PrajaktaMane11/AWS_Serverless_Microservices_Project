# AWS-Serverless-Microservices-Project
This project demonstrates a serverless architecture where microservices are deployed using AWS Lambda functions. The system exposes REST APIs via Amazon API Gateway, stores data in Amazon DynamoDB, and leverages AWS Step Functions Power Tuning to optimize Lambda performance and cost.

### Serverless Microservices

Microservices: Small, independent services that each handle a specific piece of functionality.

Serverless: You write and deploy code without provisioning or managing servers. AWS automatically handles scaling, availability, and fault tolerance.

When combined, you get modular, scalable applications that are cheaper and easier to maintain.
